# HealthWatch-A-Data-Driven-Approach-to-Mental-Health-Risk


In the initial phase of the project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset focused on older adults' health behaviors. To 
ensure the data was ready for analysis, I performed several data cleaning tasks: 

• Data Cleaning: 
o Filtered the dataset to include only relevant columns for analysis, ensuring that 
the focus remained on key health metrics such as mental distress, nutrition, 
obesity, and preventive screenings. 
o Removed duplicate entries to avoid redundancy and ensure the accuracy of the 
results. 
o Addressed missing values, particularly in demographic stratifications (such as 
race, age, and gender), to avoid skewing the analysis while maintaining the 
integrity of the dataset. 

• Data Processing: 
o Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., percentages and 
numerical values) for accurate computation and visualization. 
o Standardized data formats to ensure consistency across all analyses. 

• Visualizations: 
o Leveraged Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to generate insightful 
visualizations that highlight key trends. 
o Generated plots such as bar charts and horizontal bar charts to visualize mental 
distress by state, race, age, and gender, providing a clear understanding of 
disparities in health outcomes among older adults. 

• State-wise Analysis: A horizontal bar chart depicting the percentage of adults 
reporting frequent mental distress across different states. This visualization 
highlights states like West Virginia and Oklahama where mental distress rates are 
notably higher, enabling targeted focus for public health interventions. 

• Demographic Analysis: A grouped bar chart exploring mental distress rates among 
various demographic groups, segmented by race and gender. The analysis revealed 
disparities, with certain groups like Black, non-Hispanic and Native 
American/Alaskan Native populations showing higher rates of mental distress. 

Additionally, the gender-based analysis indicated that females reported slightly 
higher levels of distress compared to males.
